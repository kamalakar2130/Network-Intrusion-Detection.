# ðŸ›¡Network Intrusion Detection System (NIDS) using IBM AutoAI

This project implements an intelligent **Network Intrusion Detection System (NIDS)** using the **NSL-KDD dataset** and **IBM AutoAI**. The goal is to accurately classify network traffic as either normal or a type of cyber-attack (DoS, Probe, R2L, U2R), enabling early detection and improving cybersecurity.

## Problem Statement

Cyberattacks can severely compromise network systems. Manual monitoring is inefficient and prone to errors. This project aims to build a robust ML model that automates the detection and classification of intrusions, providing real-time insights for network security.

## Solution Overview

- **Dataset:** NSL-KDD (labeled network traffic with attack types)
- **Tool:** IBM AutoAI (free on IBM Cloud Lite)
- **Model Used:** Batched Tree Ensemble Classifier (Snap Random Forest)
- **Approach:**
  - Preprocess and encode 41 traffic features
  - Group attack types into 5 classes: DoS, Probe, R2L, U2R, Normal
  - Train and optimize using AutoAI
  - Deploy model via IBM Watson Machine Learning for predictions

---

## System Requirements

- IBM Cloud Lite account (Watson Studio + AutoAI access)
- Python (for local exploration, optional)
- Libraries: `pandas`, `numpy`, `scikit-learn`, `matplotlib`, `seaborn`

## Results

| Metric               | Value     |
|----------------------|-----------|
| Accuracy (Overall)   | XX.XX %   |
| Precision (Macro Avg)| XX.XX %   |
| Recall (Macro Avg)   | XX.XX %   |
| F1-Score (Macro Avg) | XX.XX %   |
| F1-Score (Weighted)  | XX.XX %   |

*Note: Replace XX.XX with actual AutoAI leaderboard results.*

## Future Scope

- Integrate with live monitoring tools (e.g., Wireshark)
- Add alert system and threat visualization
- Expand to detect zero-day attacks with DL models
- Continuous learning from live network streams
